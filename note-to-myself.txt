This planet uses universe framework.
If you are going to extend a dependency planet, like Bat for instance,
and if you have a local universe in place, then consider the following technique:




Summary:
--------------
- before working: uni tolink
- after working: uni todir; uni clean
- commit: guu



Long explanations:
---------------------
- start syncing your planets with your local universe with: uni tolink
- then, update your code (it will obviously make changes in your local universe bat, so that you can commit bat planet: no duplicate...)
- when done, put back all planets of this repository as dirs, because otherwise the new user downloading this planet will only have symlinks,
        do: uni todir
- don't forget to remove your .git .gitignore stuff before committing (otherwise the commit won't push the files): uni clean
- now you can safely commit: guu
